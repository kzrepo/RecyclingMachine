## Technical Assignment

### Task Details
Implement a reverse vending machine (bottle deposit machine), as can be found at many norwegian grocery stores. This is a machine where you the store. You are free to choose how you want present/implement the UI.

### Requirements
The product owner has put together the following list of user stories for this
application.

> RS-001  
> As a drinks' manufacturer,  
> I'd like the system to accept empty bottles  
> So that we can reacquire used bottles for recycling.  

> RS-002  
> As a drinks' manufacturer,  
> I'd like the system to accept empty cans,  
> So that we can reacquire used cans for recycling.  

> RS-003  
> As a customer,  
> I'd like the system to give me a voucher as a reward for turning in bottles,  
> So that I can buy stuff  

> RS-004  
> As a drinks' manufacturer,  
> I'd like a backend system to log whenever a bottle/can is turned in or a voucher is printed,  
> So that we can report the efficiency of each recycling station.  

### Specifications and Clarifications

- Cans are valued at 2 NOK each.
- Bottles are valued at 3 NOK each.
- Inputting a bottle/can should be represented through a UI element, e.g. a buttodsn or a console prompt.
- For the purposes of this application, it is enough to present the printed voucher on screen.
- You can assume that all containers have a valid sticker on it for valid identification.
- The hardware running on the recycling machine is only able to process cans at a rate of 0,5 per second and plastic bottles at a rate of 1 per second.
